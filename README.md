# CO~2~Sensor-Attnode_SG112a
a small functional CO2-sensor based on attnode v3 and H-Z19-CO~2~-Sensor

This PCB allows the extension of a [attno.de v3] (https://attno.de "attno.de v3") with the possibility to be operated with 5V operating voltage as well as CO2 measurement by means of MH-Z19.

The measured values of the CO2 sensor as well as the connection via LORA-WAN^(TM)^ can be visualized directly at the device by the integrated RGB-LED's, parallel to the transmission to a LoRa-Network-Server (LNS).
