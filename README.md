# CO<sub>2</sub>-Sensor-Attnode mit MH-Z19
A small functional CO<sub>2</sub>-sensor based on attnode v3 and MH-Z19-CO<sub>2</sub>-Sensor

This pcb allows the extension of the [attno.de v3](https://attno.de) with the possibility to be operated with 5V-15V operating voltage as well as CO<sub>2</sub> measurement by means of MH-Z19.

The measured values of the CO<sub>2</sub> sensor as well as the connection via LORA-WAN<sup>(TM)</sup> can be visualized directly at the device by the integrated RGB-LED's, parallel to the transmission to a LoRa-Network-Server (LNS).
