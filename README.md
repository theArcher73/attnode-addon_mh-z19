# CO<sub>2</sub>-Sensor-Attnode mit MH-Z19
A small functional AddOn CO<sub>2</sub>-Sensor to use with a [attno.de v3](https://attno.de) and MH-Z19-CO<sub>2</sub>-Sensor

You can find more information and the latest firmware at [attno.de v3](https://attno.de). [seiichiro](https://twitter.com/seiichiro0185?s=20) is continuously developing the software, which is why it is only linked here.

This pcb allows the extension of the [attno.de v3](https://attno.de) with the possibility to be operated with 5V-15V operating voltage as well as CO<sub>2</sub> measurement by means of MH-Z19.

The measured values of the CO<sub>2</sub> sensor as well as the connection via LORAWAN<sup>(TM)</sup> can be visualized directly at the device by the integrated RGB-LED's, parallel to the transmission to a LoRa-Network-Server (LNS).

The use of the MH-Z19C is strongly recommended. However, this sensor drifts over time so regular calibration is required.
The sensor can be purchased over the Silk Road or directly from German dealers.
